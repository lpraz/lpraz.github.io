I am Leila Praznik (she/her), a software developer in Brandon, Manitoba. I
currently work for [MASC][masc] as a Programmer Analyst. I hold a Bachelor of
Science (with honours) in Computer Science from [Brandon University][brandonu].

This blog is for observing things I run into as I continue to learn the craft
of programming and all it has to offer. It is useful to me as a tool for
remembering what I learn, and I hope that it proves useful to others as well,
in whatever way(s) it may.

The content of this blog is my own, and does not represent the opinions of
anyone else, including, but not limited to, my current and/or past employers.
