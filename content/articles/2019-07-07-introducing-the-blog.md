Since time immemorial, developers have discussed the benefits of [regularly][atwood] [writing][copes] a blog. So, I figured, "why not?"

This blog will be used primarily as a tool to assist in my own continuous learning. It is an oft-quoted statistic, perhaps dubious, that learners retain 90% of what they learn by teaching it to someone else immediately, and I feel a written article is perhaps one of the best ways for the least effort to do so. Even if nobody else reads it, I can still find value in the article through writing it to solidify my learning, and being able to refer back to it as necessary. This is a great thing to have in a profession where learning is essential to maintaining, let alone improving, one's skill. But if others find value in these articles, that makes it all the better.
